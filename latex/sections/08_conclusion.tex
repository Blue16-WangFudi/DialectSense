\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presented an evidence-driven dialect identification pipeline centered on robust data processing and frozen speech representations.
DialectSense combines audio QC, WavLM-Large embeddings, speaker-disjoint splitting, train-only label coarsening, and configurable coarse classifiers into a reproducible workflow.
Using stored artifacts from three runs (v1--v3), we reported coarse-cluster performance on a fixed test set and provided visual diagnostics suitable for a clean deliverable showcase.

\subsection{Future Work}

Immediate next steps are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item export run-time and hardware metadata to support stronger reproducibility claims;
    \item add a UI screenshot figure to the paper;
    \item systematically tune coarsening and classifier settings to improve both accuracy and macro-F1 under imbalance.
\end{itemize}
